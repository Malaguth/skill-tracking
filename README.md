# Skill Tracking

This repository aims to create an example of skill-tracking software made as a study exercise. 

## Agile Methodology
This project is maintained using the Scrum method with 2 weeks sprints. The Refinement, Planning, Review, and Retrospective are done with the developers and the supervisor.

The supervisor will represent the Tech Lead, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Stakeholder.

## The Product
The product itself is based on the repository [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) 

### Features and Interactions
- The first interaction will create the software structure and define how the project will be built.
- The second interaction will develop the first characteristics of the platform and define the application design.
- The third interaction will build a core feature of the skill-tracking representation.
- The fourth interaction will store the result inside a database to be accessed later.
