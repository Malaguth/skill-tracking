# Skill Tracking

This repository aims to create an example of skill-tracking software made as a study exercise. 

## Agile Methodology

The supervisor will represent the Tech Lead, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Stakeholder.

## The Product
The product itself is inspired by the repository [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) 

### Product development

### Features and Iterations
- The first iteration will create the software structure and define how the project will be built.
- The second iteration will develop the first characteristics of the platform and define the application design.
- The third iteration will build a core feature of the skill-tracking representation.
- The fourth iteration will store the result inside a database to be accessed later.
