# Team

### Product Owner

The **Product Owner** is responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog. They work closely with stakeholders to understand their needs and translate them into user stories. The Product Owner communicates these requirements to the team and ensures that they deliver maximum value.

### Scrum Master

The **Scrum Master** is a servant-leader who facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and helps the team to self-organize and continuously improve. They ensure that the team adheres to Scrum principles and practices, and also act as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences.

### Development Team

The **Development Team** consists of professionals who do the actual work of delivering a potentially releasable increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. The team is cross-functional, meaning everyone is needed to take a feature from idea to implementation. 

### Stakeholder

**Stakeholders** are individuals or groups who have an interest in the project's outcome. They can be internal or external to the organization and may include customers, users, managers, and others impacted by the product. Stakeholders provide valuable feedback and input to the Product Owner to help shape the product backlog.

### Software Architect

The **Software Architect** is responsible for making high-level design choices and dictates technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms. They work closely with the Development Team to ensure that the architectural vision is implemented effectively and meets the necessary performance, reliability, and scalability requirements.

Each member of the team brings a unique set of skills, and they collaborate closely to design, develop, test, and deliver high-quality software.

## Team Review

### [Identify Tasks and Milestones](https://github.com/users/Malaguth/projects/2)

- Adopting the agile Scrum methodology, smaller tasks were created with estimated time for each. These will be encompassed in sprints with a duration of 14 consecutive days (2 weeks).

### [Estimate Resources](https://github.com/users/Malaguth/projects/2)

- The tasks were divided and had the necessary time estimated using the Scrum Poker method, relying on both the Fibonacci sequence and T-shirt sizing.

### [Develop a Schedule](https://github.com/users/Malaguth/projects/2/views/4)

- Based on the required resources, as well as pending, ongoing, and completed tasks, a Gantt chart was created to organize them in a timely manner, with specific deadlines and endpoints.

### [Communication Plan](https://github.com/Malaguth/skill-tracking/blob/3fd4d9c23f7e17229d2cc4acfb1dcc1d18ae8eca/doc/team.md)
