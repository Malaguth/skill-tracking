# Business needs

The first step to defining the problem is understanding the business needs. This includes understanding what the business does, its goals, and how the proposed software can help achieve them. It's important to clearly understand the business context to ensure that the software solution aligns with the business objectives.

## The problem

In today's fast-paced business environment, user skill development is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. However, big companies often face a significant challenge in tracking and managing the skills of their large workforce. This issue, known as the skill-tracking problem, poses a significant barrier to effective career development for users.
The Complexity of Skill Tracking

Big companies employ thousands of individuals, each with a unique set of skills, experiences, and capabilities. Keeping track of this vast pool of talent can be overwhelming. It involves identifying the skills that each user possesses, understanding their proficiency levels, and monitoring their progress over time.

The sheer volume of data to manage, coupled with the dynamic nature of skills (which constantly evolve with new experiences and learning), makes this a complex task. Traditional methods such as manual record-keeping or basic software tools often fall short in providing an accurate, real-time view of the company's skill inventory.
Impact on Career Development

The inability to effectively track skills hampers user career development in several ways:

- Lack of Personalized Learning Plans: Without clear visibility into a user's current skill set, it's challenging to create personalized learning plans that address gaps and foster growth.

- Missed Opportunities for Advancement: If management isn't aware of a user's full range of skills, they may overlook them for promotions or special projects that could advance their career.

- Reduced Engagement and Retention: Users who don't see a clear path for skill development and career progression are likely to feel undervalued and may seek opportunities elsewhere.

## Goals

A software solution designed to address the skill-tracking problem in big companies should aim to achieve the following goals:

### Comprehensive Skill Inventory Management

The software should be capable of creating a detailed inventory of all the skills within the organization. This includes capturing the unique skills of each user, their proficiency levels, and any areas of specialization.

### Real-Time Tracking and Updating

Given the dynamic nature of skills, the software should allow for real-time tracking and updating. As users acquire new skills or improve existing ones, these changes should be reflected immediately in the system.

### Personalized Learning and Development Plans

Based on the skill inventory, the software should facilitate the creation of personalized learning and development plans for each user. These plans should target skill gaps and align with the individual's career aspirations.

### Advanced Analytics and Reporting

The software should offer advanced analytics and reporting capabilities. This could include visual dashboards that provide a snapshot of the company's skill landscape, detailed reports on individual progress, and predictive analytics to forecast future skill needs.

### User-Friendly Interface

Lastly, the software should have a user-friendly interface that encourages users to engage with it regularly. This might involve intuitive navigation, clear visuals, and features like notifications or reminders about upcoming learning opportunities.

By achieving these goals, a skill-tracking software solution can help big companies overcome the challenges associated with managing user skills, thereby fostering a culture of continuous learning and career development.

## Solution - Dynamic Roadmaps

A dynamic roadmap-based solution could be an effective way to address the skill-tracking problem in big companies. This approach would involve creating visual representations of the paths for software, design, product, and operation skills within the organization, which can be updated in real-time as users develop their capabilities.

### How It Works

- Skill Identification: The first step is to identify all the software skills within the company. This could range from basic competencies like proficiency in Microsoft Office, to more specialized skills like coding in Python or using advanced data analysis tools.

- Roadmap Creation: Once the skills are identified, they are plotted on a roadmap. Each skill forms a separate path, with different levels representing increasing proficiency. For example, a path for Python might start with 'Beginner', move to 'Intermediate', and end at 'Expert'.

- User Mapping: Users are then mapped onto the roadmaps based on their current skill levels. This provides a clear visual representation of where each user stands and what they need to do to advance along their chosen paths.

- Dynamic Updates: As users acquire new skills or improve existing ones, they move along the relevant paths on the roadmap. These changes are reflected in real-time, ensuring that the roadmaps always provide an accurate picture of the company's skill landscape.

- Personalized Learning Plans: Based on the roadmaps, personalized learning plans can be created for each user. These plans guide them along their chosen paths, helping them to close skill gaps and progress toward their career goals.

### Benefits

A dynamic roadmap-based solution offers several benefits:

- Clarity: By visually representing skills and proficiency levels, roadmaps make it easy for both users and management to understand the current skill landscape.

- Motivation: Seeing a clear path to skill development can motivate users to engage in learning and development activities.

- Personalization: Roadmaps enable the creation of personalized learning plans that cater to individual needs and aspirations.

- Real-Time Tracking: Dynamic updates ensure that the roadmaps always reflect the most current state of skills within the company.

In conclusion, a dynamic roadmap-based solution could provide an effective, user-friendly way to tackle the skill-tracking problem in big companies, fostering a culture of continuous learning and career development.
