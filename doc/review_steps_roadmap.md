- The target audience has been defined with the aim of guiding decisions and actions to ensure that they are completely satisfied.

**Analyze Competitors**

- Not yet documented. Necessary to visualize and understand possible gaps existing in competitors that can be addressed in this project.

**Gather User Feedback**

- Not yet documented

**Validate the Idea**

- Not yet documented

## Create a Project Plan

[Define Project Objectives](./business_needs.md)

- The objectives are encompassed in the solution to the problem, as well as in what we wish to achieve.

[Identify Tasks and Milestones](https://github.com/users/Malaguth/projects/2)

- Adopting the agile Scrum methodology, smaller tasks were created with estimated time for each. These will be encompassed in sprints with a duration of 14 consecutive days (2 weeks).

[Estimate Resources](https://github.com/users/Malaguth/projects/2)

- 
The tasks were divided and had the necessary time estimated using the Scrum Poker method, relying on both the Fibonacci sequence and T-shirt sizing.

[Develop a Schedule](https://github.com/users/Malaguth/projects/2/views/4)

- Based on the required resources, as well as pending, ongoing, and completed tasks, a Gantt chart was created to organize them in a timely manner, with specific deadlines and endpoints.

**Identify Risks and Mitigation Plans**

- In development in conjunction with Design Architecture.

[Communication Plan](https://github.com/Malaguth/skill-tracking/blob/3fd4d9c23f7e17229d2cc4acfb1dcc1d18ae8eca/doc/team.md)

- Communication will be based on each member's role, as well as the responsibilities and roles assumed.

## Assemble Your Team

**Identify Required Skills and Roles**

- The development team involved has deficiencies regarding the necessary skills. These will be addressed by the supervisor and other individuals involved in the project.

[Select Team Members](https://github.com/Malaguth/skill-tracking/blob/3fd4d9c23f7e17229d2cc4acfb1dcc1d18ae8eca/doc/team.md)

- The team members were selected considering existing and/or required skills. The team described in the document involves only those responsible for the overall development of the project, not limited to them, as team members have external consultants available for assistance.

[Define Roles and Responsibilities](https://github.com/users/Malaguth/projects/2)

-Through tasks, responsibilities and to-dos were defined, and they will be assumed based on each member's skills and availability of time.

**Establish Communication Channels**

- Done through the WhatsApp and Discord applications and the [Discussions](https://github.com/Malaguth/skill-tracking/discussions) tab no GitHub

**Provide Necessary Training**
- As the project progresses, some nonexistent skills are studied and acquired by the members, under the guidance of the supervisor and external consultants.

**Foster a Collaborative Environment**
- The environment is conducive to extensive communication to seek viable solutions to various obstacles that may arise.

# CONCLUSION

The project follows the previously outlined process on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/r?id=65889a0f54b577105138dda8). However, some stages have not been properly completed, documented, or executed:

- Conduct a Problem Analysis
- Gather User Feedback
- Validate the Idea

As of now, this project is at the Design the Architecture stage.
