# Project Scope for Skill-Tracking Software

The project scope for this skill-tracking software encompasses the development of a dynamic roadmap-based solution that visually represents the paths for software, design, product, and operation skills within an organization. The key features include skill identification, roadmap creation, user mapping, dynamic updates, and personalized learning plans.

## Skill Identification Module

This module will involve developing algorithms to identify and categorize all the skills within the company. It should be able to handle a wide range of competencies, from basic to specialized skills.

## Roadmap Creation Module

This module will create a visual interface where each identified skill forms a separate path with different proficiency levels. The roadmap should be intuitive and easy to understand.

## User Mapping Module

This module will involve developing functionality to map users onto the roadmaps based on their current skill levels. It should provide a clear visual representation of each user's skill status.

## Dynamic Updates Module

This module will involve creating real-time updating mechanisms. As users acquire new skills, improve existing ones, or want to update their paths, these changes should be reflected immediately on the roadmaps.

## Personalized Learning Plans Module

This module will involve developing algorithms to create personalized learning plans for each user based on their position on the roadmap. These plans should guide users along their chosen paths, helping them close skill gaps and progress toward their career goals.
