# Non-Functional Requirements for Skill-Tracking Software

## Prioritization

Prioritizing non-functional requirements can depend on various factors including the nature of the project, the specific needs of the business, and the expectations of the end-users. However, for a small team working on an MVP of a skill-tracking software, the following prioritization could be considered:

1. **User Adoption (Ease of Learning & User-Friendliness):** For an MVP, it's crucial to ensure that the product is easy to use and learn. This will help in getting valuable user feedback early on and can drive the future development of the product.

2. **Cost Efficiency (Budget Adherence):** Small teams often operate within tight budgets. Keeping costs under control is essential to the sustainability of the project.

3. **Performance:** The system should respond quickly to user requests and handle multiple concurrent users without degradation in performance.

4. **Resource Utilization (Efficient Use of Resources):** Efficient use of available resources is key when the team size is small. This includes both human resources and system resources.

5. **Security (Data Protection & Authentication and Authorization):** Even for an MVP, security cannot be compromised. Protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access are critical.

Remember, these priorities can change as the project progresses from an MVP to a full-fledged product. Regular reassessment of priorities is a good practice.

# Non-Functional Requirements description

The non-functional requirements below focus on the unique challenges faced by small projects, helping to ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget, and meets the needs of its users while maintaining a high standard of quality.

## Performance

1. **Response Time:** The system should respond to user requests within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.

2. **Throughput:** The system should be able to handle multiple concurrent users without any significant degradation in performance.

## Scalability

3. **User Load:** The system should be designed to scale and support an increase in user load. Initially, it should comfortably support the small team of users but should be capable of scaling up as more users are added.

## Security

5. **Data Protection:** The system should adhere to best practices for data protection, including encryption of sensitive data and use of secure communication protocols.
6. **Authentication and Authorization:** The system should implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the system and perform actions based on their roles.

## Usability

7. **User Experience:** The system should be intuitive and easy to use, even for non-technical 
users. It should provide clear error messages and guidance to users when needed.
8. **Accessibility:** The system should comply with accessibility standards to ensure it is usable by people with a range of abilities.

## Maintainability

9. **Code Quality:** The codebase should follow clean code principles and established coding standards to ensure it is easy to understand and maintain.
10. **Documentation:** Adequate documentation should be provided, including technical documentation for developers and user manuals for end-users.

## Supportability

11. **Monitoring and Logging:** The system should include comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to aid in troubleshooting and performance tuning.
12. **Error Reporting:** The system should have mechanisms in place for reporting errors and exceptions in a manner that aids debugging and resolution.

## Cost Efficiency

13. **Budget Adherence:** The development, maintenance, and infrastructure costs should stay within the allocated budget for the project.

## Resource Utilization

14. **Efficient Use of Resources:** The system should be designed to make efficient use of limited resources, minimizing waste and maximizing productivity.

## Scope Management

15. **Scope Control:** The system should adhere to the defined scope of the project to prevent scope creep and ensure timely delivery.

## Quality Assurance

16. **Testing:** Despite the small team size, the system should undergo thorough testing to ensure it meets all functional and non-functional requirements and delivers a high-quality user experience.

## User Adoption

17. **Friendliness:** The system should be intuitive and easy to use to encourage user adoption.

## Technical Debt Management

18. **Code Maintainability:** The system should be designed and implemented in a way that minimizes technical debt, making it easier to maintain and upgrade in the future.

## Training

19. **Ease of Learning:** The system should be easy to learn and use, minimizing the need for extensive training.
