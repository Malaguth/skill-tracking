# Technical Project Scope for Skill-Tracking Software

The technical project scope for the skill-tracking software encompasses several stages, from designing the software architecture to releasing updates for the application.

## Designing the Software Architecture

The project will begin with the design of a robust and scalable software architecture. This includes defining the system's structure, selecting appropriate technologies and frameworks, and ensuring the system can handle the expected load.

## Setting Up the Local Environment

The next step is setting up the local development environment. This involves installing necessary software and tools, configuring settings, and establishing coding standards and conventions.

## Development with Docker

The application will be developed using Docker to ensure consistency across different development environments. Docker containers will be used to isolate the application and its dependencies, ensuring that it works uniformly regardless of any differences in the underlying infrastructure.

## Developing Features and Modules

The core features and modules of the application, as described in the functional scope, will be developed. This includes the skill identification module, roadmap creation module, user mapping module, dynamic updates module, and personalized learning plans module.

## Testing the Application

The application will be thoroughly tested using the test pyramid approach. This involves conducting unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the application functions as expected.

## Creating Resources and Environments on the Cloud

Resources and environments for the application will be set up on the cloud. This includes provisioning servers, setting up databases, and configuring network settings.

## Creating a CI/CD Pipeline

A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline will be set up to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This ensures rapid and reliable delivery of updates.

## Monitoring and Maintenance Mechanisms

Mechanisms for monitoring the application's performance and maintaining its health will be put in place. This includes setting up logging, alerting, and error-tracking systems.

## Releasing Updates

Finally, the project will involve releasing updates for the application. This includes planning and executing the release process and managing version control.
