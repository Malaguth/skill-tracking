# Metodology

O projeto sera desenvolvido pautado em algumas metodologias de trabalho que permitirão a organização, delegação de tarefas, gerenciamento de recursos e comunicação eficaz entre os membros do time. Para isso, seguiremos as diretrizes abaixo:

### Identify Tasks and Milestones

- Adopting the agile Scrum methodology, smaller tasks were created with estimated time for each. These will be encompassed in sprints with a duration of 14 consecutive days (2 weeks).

### Estimate Resources

- The tasks were divided and had the necessary time estimated using the Scrum Poker method, relying on both the Fibonacci sequence and T-shirt sizing.

### Develop a Schedule

- Based on the required resources, as well as pending, ongoing, and completed tasks, a Gantt chart was created to organize them in a timely manner, with specific deadlines and endpoints.

### Communication Plan

- Communication will be based on each member's role, as well as the responsibilities and roles assumed.

### Identify Required Skills and Roles

- The development team involved has deficiencies regarding the necessary skills. These will be addressed by the supervisor and other individuals involved in the project.

### Select Team Members

- The team members were selected considering existing and/or required skills. The team outlined in the document is not an exhaustive list; it may also involve external consultants available for assistance or be expanded according to existing demands.

### Define Roles and Responsibilities

-Through tasks, responsibilities and to-dos were defined, and they will be assumed based on each member's skills and availability of time.

### Establish Communication Channels

- Performed through the WhatsApp and Discord applications, as well as the [Discussions](https://github.com/Malaguth/skill-tracking/discussions) tab on GitHub.

### Provide Necessary Training

- As the project advances, team members undertake the study and acquisition of skills that were previously non-existent, guided by the supervisor and external consultants.

## Foster a Collaborative Environment

- The environment fosters open communication to explore viable solutions to various challenges that may arise.
